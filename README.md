# DSOCIAL
DSocial is a decentralized social media DAPP that uses solidity smart contracts to store and manage data. It is very early days and this is my duke of edinburgh so please don't be too harsh... Currently it's deployed on the ropsten test network so to use it you need to go get some test eth from a ropsten faucet. I haven't deployed the website however, so you will also have to run the opennode.bat file. Then connect to localhost:8000 using your web-browser to check it out! If you want to contact me (using DSocial) or donate to me, my address is 0xc479DA9d29D528670A916ab4Bc0c4a059a9619a8 for Ethereum and Ropsten networks.
