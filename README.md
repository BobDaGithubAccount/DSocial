# DSOCIAL
DSocial is a decentralized social media DAPP that uses solidity smart contracts to store and manage data. Very early days and this is my duke of edinburgh so please don't be too harsh... Currently it's deployed on the ropsten test network so I'd recommend to go get some test eth. I haven't deployed the website howeber, so you will also have to download this repo, and using nodejs, run the command 'node index.js' while being cd'd in the server folder. Then connect to localhost:8000 to check it out! If you want to contact me (using DSocial) or donate to me, my address is 0xc479DA9d29D528670A916ab4Bc0c4a059a9619a8 for Ethereum and Ropsten networks.
